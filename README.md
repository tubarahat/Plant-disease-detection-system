## 📝 About the Project  

This project uses deep learning to analyze images of plant leaves and identify diseases. It supports a variety of crops and diseases, helping farmers take early action to protect their yield and reduce pesticide usage.  

### Features  
- Upload images of plant leaves for disease detection.  
- Provides predictions across 38 plant and disease categories.  
- Lightweight and user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## 🌟 How It Works  

1. Upload an image of a plant leaf.  
2. The app preprocesses the image and feeds it to a trained deep learning model.  
3. The model predicts the type of disease (if any) and displays the result.
